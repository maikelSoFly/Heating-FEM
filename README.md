# Heating-FEM

**Heating simulation of a 4 scm thick oven door glass window made out of two heat-resistant BOROFLOAT® 33 - Borosilicate glass panes with a space between filled with argon**. Model is surrounded with room temperature from left-hand side and **250℃ (fan-forced)** from right-hand side. Glass panes have both **width of 6 nodes (5 elements)** in the grid, which is 5 mm.

To solve such problem I used **Finite Elements Method** and some additional algorithms like Gauss's Elimination.
