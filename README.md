# Heating-FEM

**Heating simulation of a oven door glass window made out of two heat-resistant glass panes with a space between filled with argon**. Model is surrounded with room temperature from left-hand side and **250℃ (fan-forced)** from right-hand side. Glass panes have both **width of 5 nodes** in the grid, which is aproximately 5.7 mm.

To solve such problem I used **Finite Elements Method** and some additional algorithms like Gauss's Elimination.

###### All results are placed in _Results_ catalog, but here is some animation of the early phase of heating:
