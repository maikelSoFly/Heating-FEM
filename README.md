# Heating-FEM

Heating simulation of oven door glass window made out of two heat-resistant glass panes with a space between filled with argon. Model is surrounded with room temperature from left-hand side and 250â„ƒ (fan-forced) from right-hand side.

To solve such problem I used Finite Elements Method and some additional algorithms like Gauss's Elimination.

###### All results are placed in /Results catalog, but here is some animation of the early phase of heating:
